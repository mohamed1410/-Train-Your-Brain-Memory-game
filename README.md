Welcome to Train Your Brain Memory Game!

Hey there, future web developers! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Train Your Brain Memory Game. I'm Mohamed Abdel Nasser, a web development student, and I created this game to make the Brain always in training .

## What is the Train Your Brain Memory Game?

The "Train Your Brain Memory Game" is an engaging and interactive memory game designed to challenge and enhance cognitive abilities. This game provides users with a fun and effective way to exercise their memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills. Players are presented with a grid of face-down cards, each hiding a unique symbol or image. The objective is to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions and unveiling them in as few moves as possible.

## How to Play?

1. **Choose Your Level:** Select the difficulty level from the dropdown menu â€“ easy, medium, or hard.
2. **Start the Game:** Click on the cards to reveal alphabet symbols. Your goal is to match pairs and enhance your memory skills.
3. **Keep an Eye on the Timer:** Challenge yourself by completing the game in the shortest time possible.
4. **Celebrate Victories:** When you successfully match all pairs, the win screen will appear. Congratulations on your achievement!
